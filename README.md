# Testing React UI Libraries

This is a project created to test new React UI Libraries.
I've decided to out check two different libraries:

- [Next UI](https://nextui.org/)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)

## What are the key features I'm looking for?

- Many prebuild good-looking components
- Highly customizable components
- Possibility to add own css or apply css classes
- Customizable theme
- Working straight out of the box
- Easy to build forms
- Comprehensive documentation

## What does the project contain? 

I've focused mainly on the Card and Dialog component.\
These are commonly used components, hence I've\
decided that it will be worth checking how they look,\
behave and what possibilities do they offer.\
I've also implemented simple form which allows user\
to enter his personal data.

Project consists of four Card components made with\
Mantine and Next UI. Buttons on top of the page\
allow to choose which type of cards are displayed.\
After clicking on 'Buy now' button the form is shown.

## Conclusions

Working with both libraries was really convinient and easy.\
I didn't have any problems with customizing components or\
adding custom css classes or styles. Next UI and Mantine\
are in my opinion really good solutions and they allow to\
create apps faster using prebuild components. Although I\
enjoyed working with NextUI, Mantine is definitely a winner.\
NextUI lacks dropdowns, navbars, color inputs or menus to name a few.\
Mantine library offers much more components and allows you to\
build forms with different input types, sliders, checkboxes etc.\
Mantine has everything that NextUI has but it offers much more\
than that. I will use this library in my future projects for sure!

## Starting the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
